# cellar

A keyboard-driven terminal client for SQL databases — schema browser, results grid, and SQL editor in one Bubble Tea app. It speaks MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, and tunnels through SSH bastions natively, including ProxyCommand setups like AWS SSM.

## Why

I wanted a single TUI where I could open a connection, walk the schema, page through a table, edit a few rows, and run a quick query — without juggling a GUI client and an SSH config. cellar is that: everything lives in one screen, the whole thing is keyboard-first, and the SSH tunnel is built in so reaching a database behind a bastion is just part of the connection.

## Requirements

Go 1.24 or newer to build from source. No other runtime dependencies — it's a single static binary.

## Install

Clone and build with the Makefile, which drops the `cellar` binary into `~/.local/bin`:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> cellar
cd cellar
make install
```

`make install-dev` builds a version tagged with the current commit (handy while hacking), and `make build` just produces `./cellar` without installing. Override the install location with `PREFIX=/somewhere/bin make install`.

## Connections

First run lands you on the connection list. Press `a` to add one. A connection is a name plus a database URL:

```
mysql://user:pass@host:3306/dbname
postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
sqlite:///absolute/path/to/file.db
```

Connections are saved to `~/.config/cellar/config.toml`. Mark a connection read-only in the form and cellar refuses every write for it — edits, inserts, deletes, and any non-SELECT query.

### Adding connections from the command line

If your URLs come from somewhere else — a Vault cred script, an `.envrc`, whatever — you can push them into cellar without the form:

```bash
cellar --add-connection --name "orders-prod" --url "mysql://user:pass@host:3306/orders" --read-only
```

It upserts by name (re-running replaces the entry instead of duplicating it), so it's safe to call from a script that refreshes short-lived credentials. The provider is inferred from the URL scheme; pass `--provider` to override. Drop `--read-only` for a writable connection, and `--config` to target a non-default config file. The whole thing writes to `~/.config/cellar/config.toml` and exits without opening the TUI.

### SSH tunneling

Toggle SSH in the add/edit form (`ctrl+s`) and fill in the bastion host, port, user, and either a private key or a password. cellar forwards the database connection through that bastion for the life of the session. For hosts you only reach through a wrapper — AWS SSM, for example — put the full command in the proxy-command field and cellar runs it instead of dialing directly. Passphrases and passwords are kept in memory only and never written to the config file.

## Using it

`enter` on a connection opens the browser: schema tree on the left, results grid on the right. Pick a table to load its first page, then page, scroll, sort, and filter from the grid. Edit cells in place and stage inserts/deletes; staged changes are color-coded and commit together in one transaction with `ctrl+s`. Press `e` for the SQL editor — syntax-highlighted, with autocomplete and undo — and `ctrl+r` to run a query into the same grid. Open several tables at once as tabs.

Press `?` anywhere for the full keymap. The essentials:

### Connection list
